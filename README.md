[Brain-Inspired Exploration of Functional Networks and Key Neurons in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20408)

## Introduction
We find functional networks (just similar to the functional networks in human brain) exist in Large Language Models (LLMs). The neurons in functional networks that are critical to the LLM's performance. Masking key functional networks significantly impairs the model's performance, while retaining just a subset of these networks is adequate to maintain effective operation.
